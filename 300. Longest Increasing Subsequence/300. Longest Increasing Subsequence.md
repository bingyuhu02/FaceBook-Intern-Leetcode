# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Idea ( Two for loop DP )
* Time O(n^2)

## Idea ( DP + Binary search)
* Tails is an int array storing the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences with length i+1 in tails[i].

```
For example, say we have nums = [4,5,6,3], then all the available increasing subsequences are:

len = 1   :      [4], [5], [6], [3]   => tails[0] = 3
len = 2   :      [4, 5], [5, 6]       => tails[1] = 5
len = 3   :      [4, 5, 6]            => tails[2] = 6

```
* We can easily prove that tails is a increasing array. Therefore it is possible to do a binary search in tails array to find the one needs update.
* Case 1 : if current number is larger than all tails, append it, increase the size by 1
* Case 2 : if tails[i-1] < x <= tails[i], update tails[i]

## Time
* O(nlogn)
